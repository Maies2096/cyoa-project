# Jennifer-Maie CYOA
## Purpose

## Description
In this project, we were assigned to create our own "Adventure" by using our prior knowledge of linking, merging, and collaborating on Git and GitHub.

In this project we learn how to place links, aka file paths, on GitHub, that take users to another page.

## POV
You have just finished college and moved into this house. The owners have mysteroiusly dissapeared, but it only means lower payment for you. The house has an eerie-looking door that may or may not lead you to your deathbed. You have a few choices, if you choose wisely you may have a chance at survival. Good luck!
